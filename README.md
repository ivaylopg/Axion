This is basically an app version of what we presented at CERN plus some cleanup. Please let me know how it runs on your computer and let's use it as something to build from for Tribeca. I'm doing my best to squash bugs, but once it gets running on computers out of my control there are sure to be things I couldn't plan for.

If something seems wrong or isn't working, press the " i " key for HELP.  
Navigate the tunnel using "W" to move FORWARD, "S" to move BACK, and LOOK around with the MOUSE. 

The "F" key toggles Full Screen   
The ESC key Quits   
Press ANY KEY to start!

On the agenda:

* Add more video content
* Incorporate and expand Jasmine's sound design
* Develop another two to three hallways so we don't reuse the same one
* Disable ability to walk through walls in the hallway
* Develop one to two additional environments/experiences between videos so it's not just navigating a hallway
* Add support for MindWave so videos are determined not just by choosing paths, but also via EEG
* Jason wants to work with Jasmine to add narrative to the parts between videos (hallway, etc)
* Clean up and optimize code. Find bugs and DESTROY THEM!
